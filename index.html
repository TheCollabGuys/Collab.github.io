						 My name is Mattheus Stearns, Right now I am attending school in the United Arab Emirates, I am in a british
						 school, in year 7(grade 6). As of writing this, I am 12 and a half. We are nearing our end of the curriculum,
						 and I am looking forward to be going to New Jersey, US. for a year.
					</p>
					<p>
						 As this is my first website [and hopefully not my last], and I am 12, please forgive me for the terrible colours, and the
						 terrible looking template. Will work for good templates. Anyway, First I was interested at 10, because I wanted to make my
						 my own games, as we all did, but then I was sidetracked By learning Python, which is a core mechanic at this forth
						 generation of coding, and then I was given two choices: learn how to make games, or learn HTML5, which people use
						 to make websites, and as you are reading this website, I think you know which one I chose. And then I had to learn CSS,
						 which went with HTML5 hand in hand, and then I also learnt JavaScript, and Jquery. The Problem is that evryone wishes for it to be an easy
						 1 year flow, to learn at what poin I am at, but it took me two years at an hour a week to get to this point. If you want to know about me
						 go to the section labeled "About Me". Now, I know that some people aren't the nicest to me, (<i>Ahem</i> <span title="Ruari">the guy in the corner with friends, but hates only me</span> <i>Ahem</i>) but its ok.
						 They only bother me a bit. Not as much as my dad giving me the death stare for staying up 'till 2 <i> to finish this website</i>.
						 I wish I had all day, but I have to go to school tomorrow. g'night.
					 </p>
					 <p>
						 Sorry guys, I have to continue writing because I want to show you my awesome nav bar. Anyway, I would love you to check out my YouTube at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdx3TIXhfN9CT638kOUltWg">Everythingtaioplayz</a>
						 But I assume you might want to change it, so here is my github account: <a href="https://github.com/TheCollabGuys/Collab.github.io">TheCollabGuys.com</a> anyway, See you later (on another slide).
